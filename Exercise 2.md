    ### How the File Translation is Managed?

    - The end-to-end process of managing and querying a knowledge base using Azure services. The workflow includes the following key steps:

        - **Knowledge Base Storage:**
            - **Azure Storage:** Stores unstructured documents such as PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files, providing a scalable and secure repository.

        - **Data Extraction:**
            - **Azure Document Intelligence:** Automatically extracts paragraphs and dialogues from the raw documents, converting unstructured data into structured formats for further processing.
            
            - **Azure Translator:** Translates extracted text into the desired language, ensuring the system can handle multilingual queries and documents.

        - **Text Embedding and Indexing:**
            - **Azure OpenAI Service Embeddings:** Converts the extracted text into high-dimensional vectors, encapsulating semantic meaning and context.
            
            - **Azure AI Search:** Indexes these embeddings, enabling fast and efficient vector-based searches across the knowledge base.

        - **Search and Answering:**
            - **Vector Search:** Uses Azure OpenAI Embeddings to perform a semantic search, matching user queries to the most relevant documents based on vector similarity.
            
            - **Azure AI Search:** Retrieves the top k relevant paragraphs from the indexed documents.

            - **Azure OpenAI Answering Prompt:** Constructs a concise and contextually accurate response from the retrieved paragraphs. If required, answers can be translated back to the user's preferred language.

1. You can click on **Sources** to obtain the converted file in text format.

## Summary

In this exercise, you have accomplished the following:

- Created and deployed a web app from a Docker image
- Added environment variables and checked the Docker deployment
- Tested the web app

### You have successfully completed the lab.

By completing this lab **Enterprise Knowledge Base Search and Query with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search**, you gained practical experience in building intelligent search solutions powered by Azure’s AI services. You began by generating document embeddings with Azure OpenAI to capture semantic meaning and improve search relevance. You then implemented an advanced query and retrieval system using Azure AI Search, enabling efficient semantic search across the enterprise knowledge base. Additionally, you worked with Document Intelligence to extract structured data from documents and Translator to break language barriers, enhancing accessibility for global users. Finally, you automated the pipeline with Azure Functions, streamlining tasks such as document extraction, translation, embedding creation, and query handling. Through this integrated workflow, you developed a scalable knowledge search system that combines natural language understanding, multilingual support, and AI-driven insights to deliver accurate, context-aware results.
